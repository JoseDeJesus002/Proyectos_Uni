                <img id="content-img"src="img/img_senor.jpg" align="right"> Erich Fromm was an acclaimed German social psychologist,
                humanistic philosopher, democratic socialist, sociologist and
                psychoanalyst. Born on March 23rd 1900 in Germany, this accomplished
                psychologist was deeply associated with Frankfurt School of Critical
                Theory. He was the only child of orthodox Jewish parents who spent a
                rather unhappy childhood. He acquired his academic education from
                University of Frankfurt am Main for two semesters in the field of
                jurisprudence. Later, he went on to study at University of Heidelberg
                where he switched his field from jurisprudence to sociology under the
                guidance of Heinrich Rickert, Karl Jaspers and Alfred Weber. He obtained
                his PhD in sociology from university of Heidelberg in 1922 and began
                practicing as a clinical psychologist. He also acquired his psychological
                training from Frankfurt Institute of Social Research. His first work
                regarding psychological theory is presented in his paper entitled as
                Escape From Freedom which highlights his work in political psychology.

                His second most important paper Man for Himself: An inquiry into The Psychology of Ethics was an extension of his work on the first research paper. Erich Fromm's theory on human character was based on the theories presented in these two papers. According to him freedom is the most
                central trait of human nature. Free will or freedom defines a human being
                but it is a difficult attribute to achieve and incorporate in one's life
                because, surprisingly, many people in the society try to escape from
                freedom. Enrich Fromm categorized the three ways through which human
                beings try to escape from freedom; these categories are known as
                authoritarianism, destructiveness and automaton conformity.
                Authoritarianism signifies the escape from freedom by deliberately
                avoiding it through accepting an authoritarian system, by becoming a part
                of it and accepting the authority's ways whether right or wrong. The other
                way is becoming the authoritarian power and exercising unjust power over
                others through imposing a structural system. Both of these ways of
                escaping from freedom represents authoritarianism. The second category is
                destructiveness which represents suicides, violence, humiliation, criminal
                activities, terrorism and other destructive and hateful activities to
                escape from freedom. The third and last category is automaton conformity
                which is defined as confirming and accepting of the culture, ways and
                behavior to blend within the cultural surroundings. The three stages of
                escape from freedom was presented by Erich Fromm in his book in which he
                suggested that man is born with the nature of freedom but he tries to
                escape from it mainly because freedom comes with responsibility and people
                in the society tend to be conformist rather than accepting the
                responsibility of being free. Erich Fromm was also an accomplished writer.
                His books include Escape From Freedom and Man For Himself which is a
                collection of his psychological works and researches. He breathed his last
                on March 18th, 1980.
